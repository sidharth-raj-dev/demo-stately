# learn state management with xstate

this project demonstrates state management concepts using the xstate library through interactive examples.

## demo scripts

### demo_count_machine

demonstrates a simple counter machine.

![counter machine demo](assets/image1.png)

this example shows:
- basic state machine setup
- incrementing and decrementing a counter
- displaying machine output

### demo_fetch_machine 

shows how to handle asynchronous operations.

![fetch machine demo](assets/image3.png)

this example demonstrates:
- asynchronous state transitions
- handling api responses
- error states

## usage

each demo script has:
- an "execute script" button to run the example
- a "show/hide code" button to view the source

the console output shows the state machine's behavior when executed.

## code viewer

clicking "show/hide code" reveals the script source:

this allows examining the xstate implementation details.

## getting started

1. clone this repository
2. install dependencies
3. run the development server
4. open in your browser to interact with the demos
